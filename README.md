# Programming-Language
Me and 2 other students created a Programming Language on Java from scratch.

This includes implementing most major operations (maths operations, printing, variables, if statements, for loops etc.)
The program will receive a program input and it will procede to Parse, Typecheck and Evaluate the program in the corrent order to output the result.
